Observations

1. Figure Tumor Response to Treatment: Capomulin is the only drug that decreased the volume of the tumor over time. By day 40 the volume of the tumor decreased to about 37 mm3.
2. Figure Metastatic Spread During Treatment: All treatments experienced an increase in metastatic spreading during the treatment duration. Capomulin had the slowest metastatic spread and no treatment (Placebo) had the greatest amount of spreading. 
3. Figure Survival During Treatment: All drugs saw a decrease in the percentage of survival over the course of treatment. However, by day 40, Capomulin had 85% survival (highest rate) and Infubinol had 40% survival (lowest rate).
